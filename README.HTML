ISSUES: errors with appium wdio

I reinstalled JAVA
https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.12_windows-x64_bin.exe


FAILED: when running wdio with - >>    npx wdio config

INSTALLED APPIUM drivers due to issues with
appium driver install uiautomator2


Then appium was seeing the drivers

I installed plugins since it would not work without it
appium plugin install images
appium plugin install execute-driver
appium plugin install relaxed-caps
appium plugin install universal-xml


The plugin must be explicitly activated when launching the Appium server:

appium --use-plugins=images


ENSURE SDK is in the correct path for
\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk


*** REMINDER I should add any appium plugins / extenstions that can help me with this project!***


-Start adding page object model ( getters)
-add code to test file under speacs as thats whats config file will read

note: iF DEVICE UNAUTORIZE Run this command to reset authorization:

adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices

then you will see below

RF8M730VL4Y     device
emulator-5554   device

*******************************************************
IN PATH MY USER - AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator>   i RAN COMMAND BELOW TO GET THE EMULATOR WORKING ( i WILL NEED TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS CORRECT)
emulator -avd  Pixel_4_API_33

I also may need to remove this Creating WebdriverIO project in C:\Users\ndorv\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\emulator\wdio.conf.js 
as its the wrong PATH*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

ad to install  ****npx appium-installer ***** since wdio command would never complete set up and that seem to go further as I got and path I used was below
\react_mobile_automation\LoginApp>  npx appium-installer
